Toast Dismissing and clicking again (gets into a tizzy), need to kill timer on close.

Dialog actionFocus={"whatever"} does not set focus on desired action
FlatButton(Icon) has lost padding on Right Hand Side
IconFont uses className rather then iconClassName and className - need to separate concerns


IE8 Issues:
===========
Paper does not show any box-shadow         (It does now but it really suckky)

Background does not blur (no filter) on IE8

DatePicker has extra 'Paper' underneth the dates side
DatePicker Placeholder TextField does not have any text
TimePicker - the selction Handle is floating Top Left - needs to be centered.

Button "FileLoad" does not open the dialog in IE8

FloatingActionButtons are Square (should be round) (FontIcon maybe)

TextField does not clear placeholder text when you start typing
TextField puts a big black 'X' at the end of the input when typing

Picking up RGBA, Fade, Opacity, Lighten, Darken colours on components. => IE8hacks

notes
=====
If you get a "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toUpperCase' of undefined"
then the Component Name and Markup name don't match "background Vs Background"
